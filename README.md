# Uwalk
HCI Assessed Exercise 

## Description:
This project aims to encourage people to lead a more active lifestyle and improve their health by making walks more enjoyable. Our group intends to achieve this via a mobile app that incorporates audiobooks into walking to enhance the walking experience and entice users into unlocking stories by walking more

This is a basic implementation of a mobile app created from android studio.

### Home Page (Left Buttom)
This activity basically shows a image for users to click on, to start walking, with a bottom menu throughout the app.

### Walking
Once a user starts walking, a short audio clip story will be played.
After walking for 5 mins, a vibration and a visual indicator will infor user that a next audio clip is availble to be played.
This will be continued until all clips have been played and the user is done with the audio story.
To exit this activity, simple click the built in back button.

### StoryList (Middle buttom)
This activity displays all stories available to user, for their selection, along with a search function to filter based on the story title. 
*Currently only one story was built in

### Star (Right buttom)
This is meant to display user's achievement with the app.
Amount of distance walked, number of stories completed etc..
